# Slaq

Unoffical [Slack](https://slack.com/) client that doesn't eat all your RAM.
Current implementation of Slaq uses 3x less memory for same teams opened

Based on [Slackfish](https://github.com/markussammallahti/harbour-slackfish).

## How to use

Compile, build and run: `qmake && make && ./slaq`

Privacy policy, because that is necessary: We don't connect to anything apart from Slack.
